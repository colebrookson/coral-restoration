# When is Coral Restoration Viable? 

The goal of this project is to model coral resoration processes in degraded coral reefs, identifying when  restoration is a good option for assisting reefs in moving from a macroalgae dominated state into a coral dominated state. 

We use a Basin of Attraction (BOA) approach to mdoel how reefs may or may not be assisted by restoration activites.
